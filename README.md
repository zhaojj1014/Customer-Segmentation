# Customer Segmentation Analysis
customer segmentation analysis of an online learning platform

This is a practice project from Data Science 365

I have a different approach than the solution provided by the course, but I think mine makes sense.

Based on the clustering results, I recommend the following marketing strategies for the learning platform:

- Focus on consumers in North America/EURO/AUS, who yields the highest spending
- Target these consumers through social media channels such as Youtube, LinkedIn, Google
- Possible marketing strategies include ads and data science influencers

Next step:
Collect demographic data about these consumers, such as their gender/age/current occupation. This info would help choose better ads channels and influencers.
