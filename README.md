# Customer Segmentation Analysis
Customer segmentation analysis of an online learning platform

This is a practice project from Data Science 365

I have a different approach than the solution provided by the course (which clustered the customers into 8 segments), but I think mine makes sense and the resulst are clean and actionable. :)

# Customer Segments
- 0 "low value learners": avg minutes, low CLV, mostly from outside North America/UK/AUS
- 1 "high value learners": short minutes, high CLV, mostly from North America/UK/AUS 
- 2 "friend referrals": avg minutes, avg CLV, mostly from non-social media (friend, other)
- 3 "serious learners": long minutes, high CLV, smallest population 

# Recommendations for Marketing Strategies

Based on the clustering results, I recommend the following marketing strategies for the learning platform:

- Focus on consumers in North America/EURO/AUS, who yields the highest spending
- Target these consumers through social media channels such as Youtube, LinkedIn, Google, since these are how most of our target customers are acquired.
- Possible marketing strategies include ads and data science influencers. 

Next step:
Collect demographic data about these consumers, such as their gender/age/education/geographic location/current occupation/etc. This info would help us choose ads channels and influencers.
